# TERM PROJECT: Meal Planning / Meal Prep Program

## Project Proposal

The goal of this application is to *<mark style="background-color: #e4d5eb">generate well-balanced and healthy 
meals and snacks for the week</mark>* based on the ingredients that were added by the users. 
Based on my experience with meal planning and prepping, having a meal plan would help the process of
making healthy meal choices easier and more time-efficient. This application aims toward students 
and working professional who would like to eat healthier but do not know where to start.
