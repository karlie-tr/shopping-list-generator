# TERM PROJECT: Shopping List Application

## Project Proposal

The goal of this application is to *<mark style="background-color: #e4d5eb">generate a grocery list to aid in the 
process of meal prepping and planning </mark>* based on the recipes that were added by the users. 
Based on my experience with meal planning and prepping, having a meal plan and a grocery list would help the process of
making healthy meal choices easier and more time-efficient. Hence, this application aims toward students 
and working professional who would like to eat healthier.
